This is a remake in progress of a game that I once made in scratch as a kid. I wanted to code it in Vanilla Java, and so far I have this. Current planned features are:
- A HUD
- Explosions
- Animations
- A better art style
- Multiple types of ammo
- An ammo mechanic
- Space defense stage (working on it)
- Ground invasion stage
- Space offense stage
- 5 planets to play on
- ETC

# Storyline
(Disclaimer: I do not hate vegans, I just think the stereotype funny and worthy of an analogy to a Borg-like empire. Sorry to any vegans I offend.)

You are an anthropomorphic duck in America (planet form) and like burgers, bacon, and red meat in general. You live in a star system with commerce and free trade. And now a bunch of koalas from next system over got together and made the vegan version of the Borg, and are coming to, as the stereotypical pushy vegan does, push their ideology on you. You fight back by shooting burgers at them (which makes them explode, for some reason).
